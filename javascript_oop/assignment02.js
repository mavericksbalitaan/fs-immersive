// Gambling game. Create a Boxer class that has size, strength, wins and losses properties. Make sure to use the CONSTRUCTOR function to give values to all these properties.

// In the class create a function that displays the boxerâ€™s stats (Size, Strength, Wins, Losses).

// Create 2 Boxer objects and print out all the information on both boxers.

// Then use the input function to prompt the user to choose which boxer they would like to bet on.

// If the user chooses the boxer that has the best properties in size strength and wins and losses then the user wins their bet. Other wise the user loses.
